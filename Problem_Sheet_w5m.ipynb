    "This notebook accompanies the presentation on 'Classes and Functions in Python.' It includes four exercises (M1 to M4), each designed to review all concepts: defining classes, using methods, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and writing functions. Exercises include both minor code completion and writing code from scratch. Complete these exercises by filling in the blanks and writing code where indicated, then run the cells to test your solutions."

    "## M1: Managing a Library Book\n",
    "Design a system to manage a library book with its availability and borrowing status.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a `Book` class with attributes `title` (string), `author` (string), and `_available` (boolean, private), initialized via `__init__`. Use encapsulation to protect `_available`.\n",
    "2. Add a method `borrow` to set `_available` to `False` if currently available, printing 'Book borrowed,' or 'Book unavailable' otherwise. Add a method `return_book` to set it back to `True`, printing 'Book returned.'\n",
    "3. Complete the partially written `LibraryItem` base class and extend it with `Book` (inheritance). Add a derived `Magazine` class with an additional attribute `issue_number` (integer) and a method `renew` that prints 'Magazine renewed.'\n",
    "4. Implement polymorphism by ensuring `borrow` behaves differently in `Magazine` (e.g., prints 'Magazine borrowed').\n",
    "5. Write a function `time_to_read` that takes two `Time` objects (hours, minutes, seconds) and returns their sum as a new `Time` object, handling overflow correctly."
